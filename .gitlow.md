### What is GitFlow?

Gitflow is an alternative branching model in **Git**
that uses feature branches and multiple parent branches.

Gitflow has several longer **branches** and larger commits.
Under this model, developers create a feature branch
and delay merging it into the main trunk branch until the feature is complete.

What it does is assign very specific functions
to the different branches and define how and when
they should interact. In addition to feature branches,
individual branches are used to prepare, maintain,
and log releases.

## Start using it

1. Install the dependency
   `npm install gitflow`

2. Initialize gitflow (this will start git glow on your project)
   `git flow init` to mannually set the configuration, or
   `git flow init -d` to use the default configuration

## Important commands

Whenever you use `start`, a new branch is created, </br>
whenever you use `finish`, the branch is merged and deleted.</br></br>

To `add` a feature to the project:

    git flow feature start <branch_name>

When the feature is done and ready to merge to `develop`:

    git flow feature finish <branch_name>

##

- Other than `feature` branches, you could use `hotfix`, `support` or `release`

- Run `git flow support` to list all the `support` branches.
  - (Same with `feature`, `hotfix` and `release`)
