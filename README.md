## Tools 🛠️

### GitFlow 🌊

GitFlow is a branching model for Git that facilitates collaborative development and code maintenance. It defines a branch structure and a set of rules for managing project versions.

You can find more information about GitFlow [here](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

### Docker 🐳

Docker is a platform that allows you to develop, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight and portable environments that include everything needed to run an application, such as code, libraries, and dependencies.

You can get more information about Docker in the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).

### CI/CD 🔄

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are practices that automate the software development, testing, and deployment process. This ensures that code changes are integrated and deployed efficiently and seamlessly.
